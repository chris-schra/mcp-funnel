## Your responsibility
**BEFORE** creating tasks, keep in mind:
- you need to assess the current state first
- make sure to detect existing packages (recursively, use a scan for package.json, excluding **/node_modules/**)
  to understand the repo first, then check relevant files for focus.
- Remember: you are the supervisor and at this stage your main responsibility is to make sure that the implementation
  is correct. Your context is "reserved" to be bloated with useful input tokens, so go ahead, use code-reasoning MCP to get a full understanding of current implementation status.
- You **MUST** make sure that scope is clear, that there will be no duplications implemented,
  and that the tasks are small enough to be handled by an engineer.
- Your job is **NOT** to please the user, but to support them that beginning with an epic, throughout the implementation
  everything is clear, small enough, and that the implementation is correct and well-aligned.
- Your job **IS** to ask questions to the user to clarify the scope and to identify possible blockers and risks.

## CRITICAL:

- **NEVER** touch tsconfig.json or any configuration files without **EXPLICIT** user approval
- **NEVER** remove or delete tests or test files - that's a **CRIME** against our methodology
- **NEVER** touch source code - it's not your job as supervisor to touch code. **You have subagent workers for that.**
- **NEVER** use `as unknown as` type casting - violates project standards in CLAUDE.md

## Before starting

**BEFORE** starting a new phase, you **MUST** create tasks that are optimized for parallel work,
so it should be **NO** work on the same files in parallel.
Then start instances of subagent worker IN PARALLEL to work on the tasks and coordinate them.
Use as many PARALLEL worker instances as useful - CONSIDER dependencies so do NOT launch workers
in parallel that have dependencies that are not implemented or will be worked on in other tasks.

To start parallel subagent workers, you **MUST** send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.

## Iteration Plan:

### Phase 1: Fix Critical API Mismatches

**Jobs with exact locations:**

1. **Fix Registry URL** (BLOCKER - all API calls fail)
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/registry-context.ts:446`
   - Current: `return ['https://api.mcpregistry.io'];` ❌
   - Fix to: `return ['https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io'];` ✅

2. **Fix Registry ID Extraction** (BLOCKER - search→install flow broken)
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/types/registry.types.ts:56-57`
   - Current: `id: string;` at top level ❌
   - Add `_meta` structure:
     ```typescript
     _meta?: {
       'io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official': {
         id: string;
         published_at: string;
         updated_at: string;
       };
     };
     ```
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/registry-context.ts:229`
   - Current: `registryId: server.id,` ❌
   - Fix to: `registryId: server._meta?.['io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official']?.id || server.name,` ✅

3. **Fix Headers Format** (CRITICAL - remote servers broken)
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/types/registry.types.ts:45`
   - Current: `headers?: Record<string, string>;` ❌
   - Fix to: `headers?: KeyValueInput[];` ✅
   - Add KeyValueInput type:
     ```typescript
     interface KeyValueInput {
       name: string;
       value?: string;
       is_required?: boolean;
       is_secret?: boolean;
       description?: string;
     }
     ```
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/config-generator.ts:91-96`
   - Fix iteration from `Object.entries()` to `array.forEach()`

4. **Fix Environment Variable Field**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/types/registry.types.ts:18`
   - Current: `required?: boolean;` ❌
   - Fix to: `is_required?: boolean;` ✅ (or map during parsing)

5. **Verify Against Real API**:
```bash
   # Test search endpoint
   curl -X GET https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=github

   # Extract an ID from _meta field in response
   # Test get server endpoint with that ID
  curl https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers/SERVER_ID
```

**DO NOT** proceed to next phase until:
- [x] you did read this file again and make sure that you **ALWAYS** follow these instructions
- [x] `yarn validate packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES
- [x] `yarn test packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES (may have skipped tests)
- [x] you did a thorough review of all code changes using ultrathink and code-reasoning tool
- [x] verified fixes against real API using curl commands:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=github
  ```

You **MUST** run above commands **ALWAYS** from package root.

You **MUST** iterate until all issues are resolved **BEFORE** proceeding to next phase.

### Phase 2: Fix Module Structure Issues

**BEFORE** starting this phase:
- You **MUST** tick the checklist boxes for previous phase
- You **MUST** make sure that all files modified by the workers and this file have been commited

**Jobs with exact locations:**

1. **Fix Missing Exports** (forces fragile relative imports)
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/index.ts`
   - Current: Only exports interfaces and types (lines 35-41)
   - Add these exports:
     ```typescript
     export { MCPRegistryClient } from './registry-client.js';
     export { RegistryContext } from './registry-context.js';
     export { NoOpCache } from './implementations/cache-noop.js';
     export { TemporaryServerTracker } from './implementations/temp-server-tracker.js';
     export { ReadOnlyConfigManager } from './implementations/config-readonly.js';
     export { generateConfigSnippet, generateInstallInstructions } from './config-generator.js';
     ```
   - Update all imports in tools to use `from '../../registry/index.js'` instead of relative paths

2. **Fix Runtime Hint Inconsistency**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/config-generator.ts:31-42`
   - Current state:
     - Line 32: npm uses `pkg.runtime_hint || 'npx'` ✅
     - Line 36: pypi hardcoded to `'uvx'` ❌
     - Line 40: oci hardcoded to `'docker'` ❌
   - Fix to:
     ```typescript
     case 'pypi':
       entry.command = pkg.runtime_hint || 'uvx';  // Allow pipx, poetry run, etc.
       break;
     case 'oci':
       entry.command = pkg.runtime_hint || 'docker';  // Allow podman, etc.
       break;
     ```

3. **Remove Unsafe Type Casting**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/config-generator.ts:12`
   - Current: `_registry_metadata: server as unknown as Record<string, unknown>,` ❌
   - Fix to proper typing or use structured clone

**DO NOT** proceed to next phase until:
- [x] you did read this file again and make sure that you **ALWAYS** follow these instructions
- [x] `yarn validate packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES
- [x] `yarn test packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES (may have skipped tests)
- [x] you did a thorough review of all code changes using ultrathink and code-reasoning tool
- [x] all imports use registry/index.ts instead of relative paths

**Phase 2 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All module structure issues fixed, exports added, and imports updated to use centralized registry/index.js

You **MUST** run above commands **ALWAYS** from package root.

You **MUST** iterate until all issues are resolved **BEFORE** proceeding to next phase.

**Jobs with exact locations:**

1. **Fix Registry Parameter Being Ignored**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/registry-context.ts:184`
   - Current signature: `async searchServers(keywords: string): Promise<RegistrySearchResult>`
   - Fix to: `async searchServers(keywords: string, registry?: string): Promise<RegistrySearchResult>`
   - Implement filtering logic when registry parameter provided

2. **Update Tool to Pass Registry Parameter**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/tools/search-registry-tools/index.ts:68`
   - Current: `const result = await registryContext.searchServers(keywords);` ❌
   - Fix to: `const result = await registryContext.searchServers(keywords, registry);` ✅

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - File: `packages/mcp/src/registry/implementations/config-readonly.ts:47-56`
   - Add `cause` property for better error chaining:
     ```typescript
     throw new Error(
       `Failed to read config from ${this.configPath}: ${error.message}`,
       { cause: error }
     );
     ```

- [x] `yarn validate packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES
- [x] `yarn test packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES (tests still skipped)
- [x] you did a thorough review of all code changes using ultrathink and code-reasoning tool
- [x] test structure matches actual API response format

**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - All test files updated to match new API structure: _meta field added, headers as arrays, environment variable naming fixed, and mock data matches real API responses

Total: 135 registry tests passing, validation clean

You **MUST** run above commands **ALWAYS** from package root.

You **MUST** iterate until all issues are resolved **BEFORE** proceeding to next phase.

### Phase 6: Integration Testing & Validation

**BEFORE** starting this phase:
- You **MUST** tick the checklist boxes for previous phase
- You **MUST** make sure that all files modified by the workers and this file have been commited

Jobs:
- Create integration test against real registry API (with appropriate mocking)
- Test full flow: search → get details → generate config
- Validate generated configs for all package types (npm, pypi, oci, remote)

- [ ] `yarn test packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES
- [ ] you did a thorough review of all code changes using ultrathink and code-reasoning tool
- [ ] integration test demonstrates full working flow

You **MUST** run above commands **ALWAYS** from package root.

You **MUST** iterate until all issues are resolved **BEFORE** proceeding to completion.

## Key Implementation Details:

### Critical Bug Fixes (from PR review)
1. **Registry ID**: Extract from `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official.id`
2. **Registry URL**: Use `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`
3. **Headers Format**: Change from `Record<string,string>` to `KeyValueInput[]`
4. **Env Var Field**: Map `is_required` to `required`
5. **Missing Exports**: Export all implementations from index.ts
6. **Runtime Hint**: Apply consistently to all package types
7. **Registry Filter**: Implement registry parameter in search
8. **Type Casting**: Remove all `as unknown as` usage

### API Response Structure (Actual)
```json
{
  "servers": [{
    "name": "server-name",
    "_meta": {
      "io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official": {
        "id": "uuid-here",
        "published_at": "timestamp",
        "updated_at": "timestamp"
      }
    },
    "remotes": [{
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "Authorization",
          "value": "Bearer ${TOKEN}",
          "is_required": true,
          "is_secret": true
        }
      ]
    }]
  }]
}
```

### Testing Requirements
