# Review Findings

This document is **append-only**. **Do not** delete prior content. Every AI/agent **MUST**:
- follow the structure below
- add a personal checklist under each issue it touches
- log decisions with evidence
- use the “New Issue Intake” template when discovering new issues

---

## Global Rules for All Agents

- **Scope:** Findings relate to code, tests, build/release, security, performance, and behavior.
- **Append-only:** Never remove or rewrite prior findings; add updates as new “Agent Notes” or “Validation Updates”.
- **Evidence first:** Any claim must include **file paths + line ranges** or **external references**. If missing, mark it **ASSUMPTION** and lower confidence.
- **Confidence:** Always include `confidence: 0–1` (subjective, but consistent).
- **Status lifecycle:** `OPEN` → `CONFIRMED` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `FIXED` → `DISPROVEN` (or `WON’T_FIX`).
- **IDs:** For new issues, use `ISSUE-COMMITHASH-###` (monotonic per commit). Example: `ISSUE-8D0B73B-001`.
- **Your identity:** Record `agent_id` (e.g. codex, claude, gemini), `model`  (e.g. sonnet, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-5-codex high) and optional `run_id`.
- **No silent edits:** If you disagree, add a **counterfinding** with evidence; do **not** alter prior text.
- **Checklists:** Every agent must attach **its own checklist** for each issue it touches (see “Agent Checklist”).
- **New issues:** Use “New Issue Intake” exactly. Link to repro, logs, and diffs where possible.

## Evidence Quality Score (= Confidence)

- **E0 (Assumption):** No source cites. Hypothesis only.
- **E1 (Type-level):** API/typing/docs cited (e.g., `index.d.ts`, official docs).
- **E2 (Code-level):** Concrete file + lines referenced.
- **E3 (Runtime-level):** Repro steps, logs, traces, screenshots.
- **E4 (Test-level):** Failing/passing tests proving the point.
- **E5 (Cross-env):** Verified across OS/node versions/build targets.

Agents should strive to upgrade evidence quality with each pass.

## New Issue Intake (Use verbatim for newly discovered issues)

### [ISSUE-ID] Title
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** 🔴 Critical | 🟠 High | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Low
- **Confidence:** E0 | E1 | E2 | E3 | E4 | E5
- **Area:** Security | Auth | Transport | Memory | API | CLI | Build | Test | Docs | Other
- **Summary (1–3 sentences):**  
  <short, neutral summary>

#### Observation
(neutral description of what was seen)

#### Assumptions
(list clearly, but concise and briefly; if none, write: none)

#### Risk / Impact
(what is affected, worst plausible outcome)

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `<path>:Lx–Ly`
- **Docs/Types:** link/name + quoted excerpt if applicable
- **Tests:** (existing/new tests; names/paths -> failing/passing)
- **Repro (optional):** steps/commands
- **Logs (optional):** <snippets>

#### Proposed Resolution
(minimal viable fix, alternatives, tradeoffs; if unknown, write “TBD”)

#### Validation Plan
(how to prove fixed: tests, manual steps, tooling)

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- <agent_id | model | commit_sha> … (short note + any counters or nuance)

#### Agent Checklist (MANDATORY per agent)
- **Agent:** <agent_id> | **Model:** <model> | **Run:** <run_id?> | **Commit:** <commit_sha>
    - [ ] Read code at all referenced locations
    - [ ] Verified API/types against official source
    - [ ] Reproduced (or attempted) locally/in CI
    - [ ] Classified **Assumption vs Evidence**: E0 | E1 | E2 | E3 | E4 | E5
    - [ ] Proposed or refined fix
    - [ ] Set/updated **Status**

## Validation Updates (per Issue)

Use this block to advance status across the lifecycle. One entry per change.

- **[ISSUE-ID] – Status Change:** OPEN → CONFIRMED (or other)  
  **By:** <agent_id | model | commit_sha>  
  **Reason/Evidence:** <short reason + refs>  
  **Commit/PR:** <hash/URL if relevant>  
  **Next Step:** <who/what/when>

(Repeat as needed; do not delete history.)

## Agent Working Protocol

1. **If you find a new issue:** Instantiate with **New Issue Intake**.
2. **If you touch an existing issue:** Add a **new “Agent Notes” entry** and your **Agent Checklist**.
3. **If evidence is missing/weak:** Mark `Evidence: E0/E1` and state what you tried.
4. **If you dispute a claim:** Add a **counterfinding** in Agent Notes, cite stronger evidence, and suggest a status change.
5. **If you fix something:** Add a **Validation Update** with commit/PR and propose `IN_PROGRESS` → `FIXED`.
6. **If disproven:** Add evidence and move `Status` to `DISPROVEN`; keep the record.
