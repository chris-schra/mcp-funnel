# Review Findings

This document is **append-only**. **Do not** delete prior content. Every AI/agent **MUST**:
- follow the structure below
- add a personal checklist under each issue it touches
- log decisions with evidence
- use the "New Issue Intake" template when discovering new issues

---

## Global Rules for All Agents

- **Scope:** Findings relate to code, tests, build/release, security, performance, and behavior.
- **Append-only:** Never remove or rewrite prior findings; add updates as new "Agent Notes" or "Validation Updates".
- **Evidence first:** Any claim must include **file paths + line ranges** or **external references**. If missing, mark it **ASSUMPTION** and lower confidence.
- **Confidence:** Always include `confidence: 0â€“1` (subjective, but consistent).
- **Status lifecycle:** `OPEN` â†’ `CONFIRMED` â†’ `IN_PROGRESS` â†’ `FIXED` â†’ `DISPROVEN` (or `WON'T_FIX`).
- **IDs:** For new issues, use `ISSUE-COMMITHASH-###` (monotonic per commit). Example: `ISSUE-8D0B73B-001`.
- **Your identity:** Record `agent_id` (e.g. codex, claude, gemini), `model`  (e.g. sonnet, gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-5-codex high) and optional `run_id`.
- **No silent edits:** If you disagree, add a **counterfinding** with evidence; do **not** alter prior text.
- **Checklists:** Every agent must attach **its own checklist** for each issue it touches (see "Agent Checklist").
- **New issues:** Use "New Issue Intake" exactly. Link to repro, logs, and diffs where possible.

---

## Evidence Quality Score (= Confidence)

- **E0 (Assumption):** No source cites. Hypothesis only.
- **E1 (Type-level):** API/typing/docs cited (e.g., `index.d.ts`, official docs).
- **E2 (Code-level):** Concrete file + lines referenced.
- **E3 (Runtime-level):** Repro steps, logs, traces, screenshots.
- **E4 (Test-level):** Failing/passing tests proving the point.
- **E5 (Cross-env):** Verified across OS/node versions/build targets.

Agents should strive to upgrade evidence quality with each pass.

---

## Common pitfalls to avoid

- **Interfaces / types**: Do not assume types/interfaces are wrong without verification:
  - for internal types or interfaces, check the exported type or interface in actual file (imported by call-site)
  - for external types or interfaces, check the exports in package in node_modules (in repo root and in node_modules - if applicable - of the current package in our monorepo)

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-001] Mock-only tests in SecretManager violate core testing principle
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Test
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  All SecretManager tests use MockSecretProvider instead of real implementations, directly violating the project's explicit testing principle against mock-based tests.

#### Observation
SecretManager test suite exclusively uses MockSecretProvider for all tests. No integration tests exist with actual DotEnvProvider, ProcessEnvProvider, or InlineProvider implementations.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
False confidence in test coverage. Real bugs in provider integration would not be caught. Tests provide no validation that the secret provider architecture actually works in production.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/__tests__/secret-manager.test.ts`
- **Docs/Types:** Project documentation explicitly states: "Do NOT create tests to test mocks, they are giving a false impression of coverage"
- **Tests:** All SecretManager tests use MockSecretProvider
- **Repro (optional):** Review test file to confirm no real provider instances
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Replace mock-based tests with real integration tests using actual provider implementations. Create test fixtures with real .env files and environment variables.

#### Validation Plan
Rewrite tests to use real providers. Verify tests still pass and actually exercise the production code paths.

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-002] Server disconnections not handled
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸ”´ Critical
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Transport
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  TODO comment indicates server disconnection handling is unimplemented, leaving system unable to recover from MCP server crashes or disconnects.

#### Observation
Code contains "TODO: handle disconnects" comment at index.ts:652 with no implementation for server disconnection recovery.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
System reliability compromised. If an MCP server crashes or disconnects, the proxy cannot recover, potentially requiring manual restart and causing service disruption.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/index.ts:652`
- **Docs/Types:** N/A
- **Tests:** No tests for disconnection handling
- **Repro (optional):** Kill an MCP server process while running
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Implement reconnection logic with exponential backoff. Add health checks and automatic recovery mechanisms.

#### Validation Plan
Add tests simulating server disconnections and verify automatic recovery. Test with actual server process kills.

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-003] Mocked file system in DotEnvProvider tests
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  High
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Test
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  DotEnvProvider tests use vi.mock('fs') and vi.mock('path'), never testing actual .env file reading or parsing logic with real files.

#### Observation
Tests mock the file system instead of using real .env files. The parsing logic is tested against mocked readFileSync that returns predetermined values.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Actual .env file parsing bugs would not be caught. Tests pass because they test mocked file operations, not real implementation.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/providers/__tests__/dotenv-provider.test.ts`
- **Docs/Types:** Uses vi.mock('fs') and vi.mock('path')
- **Tests:** All DotEnvProvider tests use mocked file system
- **Repro (optional):** Review test file for vi.mock usage
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Use real .env test fixtures in temporary directories. Test actual file reading and parsing behavior.

#### Validation Plan
Create tests with real .env files containing edge cases. Verify parser handles real-world scenarios.

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-004] Broken .env parser missing standard features
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  High
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** API
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  Custom .env parser lacks support for standard features like multiline values, escape sequences, export statements, and variable interpolation.

#### Observation
The implementation uses a custom parser that only handles basic KEY=VALUE format. Missing support for multiline values, escape sequences (\n, \t), export statements, variable interpolation ($VAR, ${VAR}), backslash continuations, and Unicode escapes.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Parser will fail on real-world .env files that use standard features. Users' existing .env files may not work, causing configuration failures.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/providers/dotenv-provider.ts`
- **Docs/Types:** Custom parser implementation reviewed
- **Tests:** No tests for complex .env features
- **Repro (optional):** Try parsing .env with multiline values or variable interpolation
- **Logs (optional):** Example that would break:
```env
export DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:pass@host/db\
?sslmode=require"
API_KEY="multi
line
value"
PATH_WITH_VAR="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Proposed Resolution
Use battle-tested dotenv library instead of custom parser. If custom parser needed, implement full spec compliance.

#### Validation Plan
Test with comprehensive .env file containing all standard features. Compare behavior with dotenv library.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Incomplete parser implementation from PR #14

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-005] No end-to-end integration tests
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ  High
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Test
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  No tests verify SecretManager with real providers and real files working together end-to-end.

#### Observation
Test suite lacks integration tests that verify the complete flow of SecretManager + real providers + actual configuration files.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Integration bugs between components would not be caught. The claim that the "secret provider architecture works" remains unverified.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/__tests__/` directory
- **Docs/Types:** No integration test files found
- **Tests:** 555 passing tests but none test real integration
- **Repro (optional):** Search for integration tests in codebase
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Create comprehensive integration test suite that tests SecretManager with all real providers using actual files and environment variables.

#### Validation Plan
Write tests that exercise complete user scenarios. Verify secrets are correctly resolved from multiple sources with proper precedence.

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-006] Unused SecretProviderRegistry violates SEAMS principle
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** API
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  SecretProviderRegistry exists but is never used in production code, only in mock tests. Violates SEAMS principle of not building unused features.

#### Observation
SecretProviderRegistry is defined and tested but never instantiated or used in actual production code paths.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Code complexity without benefit. Maintenance burden for unused code. Violates project principle: "implement only what's immediate."

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/secret-manager.ts` - registry parameter
- **Docs/Types:** SEAMS principle: "Build the socket, not the plug"
- **Tests:** Registry only appears in mock tests
- **Repro (optional):** Search for SecretProviderRegistry usage in production code
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Remove unused registry code or document clear use case for future implementation.

#### Validation Plan
Verify removal doesn't break any production functionality. Ensure tests still pass after cleanup.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Over-engineering identified in PR #14

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-007] Unused caching system in SecretManager
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Memory
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  Complex cache implementation with TTL in SecretManager is never used because new instances are always created.

#### Observation
SecretManager implements caching with TTL and expiration logic, but production code always creates new SecretManager instances, making the cache ineffective.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Unnecessary complexity. Performance optimization that provides no benefit. Violates YAGNI principle.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/secret-manager.ts` - caching implementation
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/index.ts:584,604` - new instances created
- **Docs/Types:** Cache logic implemented but never utilized
- **Tests:** Tests for caching that test unused feature
- **Repro (optional):** Trace SecretManager instantiation in production flow
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Either implement singleton pattern for SecretManager to utilize cache or remove caching logic entirely.

#### Validation Plan
Profile memory and performance impact. Verify behavior remains consistent after changes.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Unused optimization from PR #14

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-008] DRY violations with repeated code patterns
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** API
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  Multiple DRY violations including repeated getName() methods, duplicate SecretManager instantiation, and constructor boilerplate across providers.

#### Observation
Code contains repeated patterns: getName() method in every provider returning hardcoded strings, duplicate SecretManager instantiation at lines 584 and 604 in index.ts, and similar constructor patterns across all providers.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Maintenance burden. Changes require updates in multiple places. Increased chance of inconsistencies.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/index.ts:584,604` - duplicate instantiation
- **Files/Lines:** All provider files - repeated getName() methods
- **Docs/Types:** DRY principle: "Do NOT violate DRY"
- **Tests:** N/A
- **Repro (optional):** Review provider implementations
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Extract common patterns to base class or helper functions. Use factory pattern for SecretManager instantiation.

#### Validation Plan
Refactor and verify all tests still pass. Check for behavior consistency.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Code duplication from PR #14

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-009] Fake timer test making async test meaningless
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** Test
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  Async resolution test uses fake timers, essentially becoming a synchronous test that doesn't verify real async behavior.

#### Observation
Test for async resolution was "fixed" using fake timers, which defeats the purpose of testing async behavior. Test now verifies fake timer behavior, not actual async resolution.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Real async bugs would not be caught. Test provides false confidence about async behavior.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/__tests__/secret-manager.test.ts:243`
- **Docs/Types:** Test comment: "should use cache if implemented"
- **Tests:** Uses vi.useFakeTimers()
- **Repro (optional):** Review async test implementation
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Rewrite test to verify actual async behavior without fake timers. Use proper async/await patterns.

#### Validation Plan
Test with real async operations. Verify timing-sensitive behavior works correctly.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Flaky test "fix" that removes test value

### [ISSUE-DE9467B-010] console.error for error handling instead of proper logging
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Severity:** ðŸŸ¢ Low
- **Confidence:** E2
- **Area:** API
- **Summary (1â€“3 sentences):**
  Error handling uses console.error directly instead of proper logging strategy with no error recovery mechanism.

#### Observation
Errors are handled by dumping to console.error at secret-manager.ts:99 with no structured logging or recovery strategy.

#### Assumptions
none

#### Risk / Impact
Poor observability in production. Difficult to track and debug issues. No structured error handling.

#### Evidence
- **Files/Lines:** `packages/mcp/src/services/secret-manager.ts:99`
- **Docs/Types:** Uses console.error directly
- **Tests:** No tests for error handling
- **Repro (optional):** Trigger error in SecretManager
- **Logs (optional):** N/A

#### Proposed Resolution
Implement proper logging abstraction. Add structured error handling with recovery strategies where appropriate.

#### Validation Plan
Test error scenarios. Verify errors are properly logged and handled.

#### Agent Notes (do not delete prior notes)
- claude | opus-4.1 | de9467b - Basic error handling issue from PR #14
