# CI/CD Requirements

## Current State
The repository currently has no GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/` directory does not exist).

## Required CI/CD Pipeline

### Core Validation Steps
- `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `yarn validate` - Run linting and type checking
- `yarn test` - Execute test suite

### Matrix Testing
- **Node.js versions**: 18, 20, 22
- **Operating systems**: ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest

### Benefits
- Prevents timing-sensitive test failures in different environments
- Ensures cross-platform compatibility
- Catches integration issues before merge
- Validates code quality standards consistently

## Recommendation
Add GitHub Actions workflow before merging future PRs to maintain code quality and prevent environment-specific issues.

## Implementation Priority
High - Should be implemented before significant development continues.
