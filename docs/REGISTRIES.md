# MCP Registry Integration

The MCP Registry integration enables discovery and installation of Model Context Protocol servers from the official
registry. This feature provides tools to search for available servers and retrieve their installation configurations.

## Overview

The registry integration provides two primary capabilities:
- **Server Discovery**: Search the MCP registry to find servers matching your needs
- **Installation Guidance**: Get detailed configuration snippets and instructions for any server

## Available Tools

### 1. `search_registry_tools`

Search the MCP registry for servers by keywords.

**Parameters:**
- `keywords` (required): Space-separated keywords to search for in server names, descriptions, and tool names
- `registry` (optional): Registry ID to search within a specific registry (e.g., "official", "community")

**Example Usage:**
```
search_registry_tools keywords="github code review"
```

**Returns:** Minimal server information optimized for token efficiency:
- Server name
- Brief description
- Registry ID (for retrieving full details)
- Server type (Local/Remote)
- Registry type

### 2. `get_server_install_info`

Retrieve detailed installation instructions and configuration for a specific server.

**Parameters:**
- `registryId` (required): The unique registry identifier for the server (obtained from search results)

**Example Usage:**
```
get_server_install_info registryId="github-mcp-server"
```

**Returns:** Complete installation information:
- Server name and description
- Configuration snippet ready to add to your `.mcp-funnel.json`
- Installation instructions specific to the package type
- List of available tools the server provides

## Configuration Format

The registry system generates configuration snippets compatible with mcp-funnel's `.mcp-funnel.json` format.
Configurations are automatically generated based on the server's package type.

### Supported Package Types

#### NPM Packages
Servers distributed via npm are configured with the `npx` command:
```json
{
  "name": "example-npm-server",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@org/package-name"]
}
```

#### Python Packages (PyPI)
Python servers use `uvx` for execution:
```json
{
  "name": "example-python-server",
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["package-name"]
}
```

#### OCI Containers
Container-based servers run via Docker:
```json
{
  "name": "example-container-server",
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "registry.io/image:tag"]
}
```

#### Remote Servers
Remote servers are accessed via HTTP/HTTPS:
```json
{
  "name": "example-remote-server",
  "remote": "https://api.example.com/mcp"
}
```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Search for servers** using relevant keywords:
   ```
   search_registry_tools keywords="filesystem git"
   ```

2. **Review search results** to find servers matching your needs

3. **Get installation details** using the registry ID:
   ```
   get_server_install_info registryId="server-id-from-search"
   ```

4. **Add the configuration** to your `.mcp-funnel.json` file

5. **Follow installation instructions** specific to the package type

## Example: Complete Installation Flow

### Step 1: Search for GitHub-related servers
```
> search_registry_tools keywords="github"
```

Response:
```
Found 3 servers matching your search:

â€¢ github-mcp-server (github-mcp-server)
  MCP server for GitHub API integration
  Type: Local | Registry: npm

â€¢ github-actions-server (gh-actions-mcp)
  Manage GitHub Actions workflows via MCP
  Type: Local | Registry: npm

â€¢ github-copilot-bridge (copilot-bridge)
  Bridge GitHub Copilot with MCP tools
  Type: Remote | Registry: unknown

ðŸ’¡ Use get_server_install_info with a registryId to get installation details for any server.
```

### Step 2: Get installation info for a specific server
```
> get_server_install_info registryId="github-mcp-server"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "name": "github-mcp-server",
  "description": "MCP server for GitHub API integration",
  "configSnippet": {
    "name": "github-mcp-server",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
    "env": {
      "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
    }
  },
  "installInstructions": "1. Ensure you have Node.js installed\n2. Set your GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable\n3. Add the configuration snippet to your .mcp-funnel.json\n4. Restart mcp-funnel to load the new server",
  "tools": [
    "create_issue",
    "list_issues",
    "get_pull_request",
    "create_pull_request",
    "list_repositories"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Add to configuration
Add the `configSnippet` to your `.mcp-funnel.json`:
```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "github-mcp-server",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Architecture

The registry integration is built with extensibility in mind, featuring:

### Singleton Pattern
The `RegistryContext` class implements a singleton pattern to ensure consistent state and shared resources across all registry operations.

### Caching Layer
An abstraction layer for caching (currently using no-op implementation) reduces redundant API calls and improves response times.

### Configuration Management
A flexible configuration system supports multiple package types and generates appropriate configuration snippets for each.

### Token Efficiency
Search results return minimal information to reduce token usage, with full details available on demand via `get_server_install_info`.

## Error Handling

The registry tools include comprehensive error handling:
- Network failures are caught and reported with helpful messages
- Invalid registry IDs return clear "not found" messages
- Malformed requests provide specific parameter validation errors
- Registry API errors are propagated with status information

## Registry API

The system connects to the official MCP registry at:
- Primary endpoint: `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`

The registry API provides:
- Server search with keyword matching
- Individual server detail retrieval
- Package distribution information
- Tool listings for each server

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific keywords** when searching to get more relevant results
2. **Check tool lists** before installing to ensure the server provides needed functionality
3. **Review environment variables** required by servers before installation
4. **Test servers individually** after adding to configuration
5. **Keep registry IDs** from search results for later reference

## Troubleshooting

### No search results
- Try broader keywords
- Check spelling and terminology
- Ensure network connectivity to the registry

### Server not found by ID
- Verify the registry ID from search results
- The server may have been removed from the registry
- Try searching again with related keywords

### Configuration not working
- Ensure all required environment variables are set
- Check that the package manager (npm/pip/docker) is installed
- Verify network access to package repositories
- Review server-specific installation instructions

## Current Limitations

- Configuration changes require manual editing of `.mcp-funnel.json`
- After adding or modifying servers in `.mcp-funnel.json`, you need to restart the mcp-funnel proxy process 
  for changes to take effect (the proxy doesn't hot-reload configuration)
- The current implementation uses a no-op cache (NoOpCache) that doesn't actually store anything -
  all registry API calls fetch fresh data every time
- Registry search is keyword-based without advanced filtering options
