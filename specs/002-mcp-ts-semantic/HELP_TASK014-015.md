# Help Document: Pre-existing TypeScript Compilation Issue

## Task Context
Tasks 014-015: Implementation of DynamicOverrideManager and MCPProxy getter/setter

## Issue Description
During implementation of the dynamic override system, I discovered a pre-existing TypeScript compilation error in `packages/mcp/src/overrides/override-manager.ts`:

```
❌ [typescript:82:11] Duplicate function implementation. (TS2393)
❌ [typescript:257:11] Duplicate function implementation. (TS2393)
```

## Root Cause
The file contains two implementations of the `applyPropertyOverrides` method:
- First implementation at line 82
- Second implementation at line 257

This is a duplicate function declaration which TypeScript rightfully flags as an error.

## Impact on Current Tasks
- **TASK-014**: ✅ COMPLETED - DynamicOverrideManager class created successfully
- **TASK-015**: ✅ COMPLETED - MCPProxy getter/setter added successfully
- All new code compiles correctly and validates without issues
- The duplicate function issue is unrelated to the dynamic override system implementation

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented:

1. **DynamicOverrideManager class** in `packages/mcp/src/overrides/dynamic-overrides.ts`
   - `updateOverrides()` method for bulk override updates
   - `setOverride()` method for single override modification
   - `removeOverride()` method for override removal
   - Proper cache refresh and notification system

2. **MCPProxy getters/setters** in `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`
   - `get overrideManager()` getter method
   - `set overrideManager()` setter method
   - Placed after existing server getter as requested

3. **Export updates**
   - Added DynamicOverrideManager export to `packages/mcp/src/overrides/index.ts`
   - Added DynamicOverrideManager to main exports in `packages/mcp/src/index.ts`

## Files Modified/Created
- ✅ Created: `packages/mcp/src/overrides/dynamic-overrides.ts`
- ✅ Modified: `packages/mcp/src/index.ts` (added getter/setter + export)
- ✅ Modified: `packages/mcp/src/overrides/index.ts` (added export)

## Validation Status
- All newly created/modified files validate successfully
- TypeScript compilation works for all new dynamic override system code
- The pre-existing duplicate function issue in override-manager.ts requires separate resolution

## Recommendation
The duplicate function implementation in `override-manager.ts` should be addressed in a separate task focused on fixing existing codebase issues, as it's unrelated to the dynamic override system implementation.
